## Waterlog

[Waterlog](https://waterlogjadeite.azurewebsites.net/) was a secondary application created as part of a university group project. Its main purpose is to provide information to the users about the main product of the project, which is a smart water meter reading device. Users can also view their water usage data by entering their unique meter id which will retrieve data from the firebase database.  

## Technology and knowledge

The technologies used during the development of this web application included HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Firebase was also used to store the data collected by the smart device. I learnt how to use JavaScript to read data from the database and to present it in the form of a dashboard to the user.

## Acknowledgements
The home page used [Owl Carousel]( https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) to present images of the mobile application. The dashboard used [Chart.js]( https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) for creating graphs and [Siema carousel](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/siema) for presenting multiple graphs.
